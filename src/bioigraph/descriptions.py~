            To build up the human signaling network, we manually curated the signaling molecules (most of them are proteins) and the interactions between these molecules from the most comprehensive signaling pathway database, BioCarta (http://www.biocarta.com/). The pathways in the database are illustrated as diagrams. We manually recorded the names, functions, cellular locations, biochemical classifications and the regulatory (including activating and inhibitory) and interaction relations of the signaling molecules for each signaling pathway. To ensure the accuracy of the curation, all the data have been crosschecked four times by different researchers. After combining the curated information with another literature‐mined signaling network that contains ∼500 signaling molecules (Ma'ayan et al, 2005)[this is the CA1!!!], we obtained a signaling network containing ∼1100 proteins (Awan et al, 2007). We further extended this network by extracting and adding the signaling molecules and their relations from the Cancer Cell Map (http://cancer.cellmap.org/cellmap/), a database that contains 10 manually curated signaling pathways for cancer. As a result, the network contains 1634 nodes and 5089 links that include 2403 activation links (positive links), 741 inhibitory links (negative links), 1915 physical links (neutral links) and 30 links whose types are unknown (Supplementary Table 9). To our knowledge, this network is the biggest cellular signaling network at present.
            To construct the human cellular signalling network, we manually curated signalling pathways from literature. The signalling data source for our pathways is the BioCarta database (http://www.biocarta.com/genes/allpathways.asp), which, so far, is the most comprehensive database for human cellular signalling pathways. Our curated pathway database recorded gene names and functions, cellular locations of each gene and relationships between genes such as activation, inhibition, translocation, enzyme digestion, gene transcription and translation, signal stimulation and so on. To ensure the accuracy and the consistency of the database, each referenced pathway was cross-checked by different researchers and finally all the documented pathways were checked by one researcher.

            We used published research literature to identify the key components of signaling pathways and cellular machines, and their binary interactions. Most components (~80%) have been described in hippocampal neurons or related neuronal cells. Other components are from other cells, but are included because they are key components in processes known to occur in hippocampal neurons, such as translation. We then established that these interactions were both direct and functionally relevant. All of the connections were individually verified by at least one of the authors of this paper by reading the relevant primary paper(s). We developed a system made of 545 components (nodes) and 1259 links (connections). We used arbitrary but consistent rules to sort components into various groups. For instance, transcription factors are considered a as part of the transcriptional machinery, although it may also be equally valid to consider them as the most downstream component of the central signaling network. Similarly the AMPA receptor-channel (AMPAR) is considered part of the ion channels in the electrical response system since its activity is essential to defining the postsynaptic response, although it binds to and is activated by glutamate, and hence can be also considered a ligand gated receptor-channel in the plasma membrane. The links were specified by two criteria: function and biochemical mechanism. Three types of functional links were specified. This follows the rules used for representation of pathways in Science’s STKE (S1). Links may be activating, inhibitory or neutral. Neutral links do not specify directionality between components, and are mostly used to represent scaffolding and anchoring undirected or bidirectional interactions. The biochemical specification includes defining the reactions as non-covalent binding interactions or enzymatic reactions. Within the enzymatic category, reactions were further specified as phosphorylation, dephosphorylation, hydrolysis, etc. These two criteria for specification are independent and were defined for all interactions. For the analyses in this study we only used the functional criteria: activating, inhibitory or neutral specifications. We chose papers that demonstrated direct interactions that were supported by either biochemical or physiological effects of the interactions. From these papers we identified the components and interactions that make up the system we analyzed. During this specification process we did not consider whether these interactions would come together to form higher order organizational units. Each component and interaction was validated by a reference from the primary literature (1202 papers were used). A list of authors who read the papers to validate the components and interactions is provided under authors contributions.

            Ongoing analysis of macrophage-related datasets and an interest in consolidating our knowledge of a number of signalling pathways directed our choice of pathways to be mapped (see Figure 1). Public and propriety databases were initially used as resources for data mining, but ultimately all molecular interaction data was sourced from published literature. Manual curation of the literature was performed to firstly evaluate the quality of the evidence supporting an interaction and secondly, to extract the necessary and additional pieces of information required to 'understand' the pathway and construct an interaction diagram. We have drawn pathways based on our desire to model pathways active in a human macrophage and therefore all components have been depicted using standard human gene nomenclature (HGNC). However, our understanding of the pathway components and the interactions between them, have been drawn largely from a consensus view of literature knowledge. As such the pathways presented here are based on data derived from a range of different cellular systems and mammalian species (human and mouse).

            The initial annotation process of any signaling pathway involves gathering and reading of review articles to achieve a brief overview of the pathway. This process is followed by listing all the molecules that arereported to be involved in the pathway under annotation. Information regarding potential pathway authorities are also gathered at this initial stage. Pathway experts are involved in initial screening of the molecules listed to check for any obvious omissions. In the second phase, annotators manually perform extensive literature searches using search keys, which include all the alter native names of the molecules involved, the name of the pathway, the names of reactions, and so on. In addition, the iHOP resource is also used to perform advanced PubMed-based literature searches to collect the reactions that were reported to be implicated in a given pathway. The collected reactions are manually entered using the PathBuilder annotation interface, which is subjected to an internal review process involving PhD level scientists with expertise in the areas of molecular biology, immunology and biochemistry. However, there are instances where a molecule has been implicated in a pathway in a published report but the associated experimental evidence is either weak or differs from experiments carried out by other groups. For this purpose, we recruit several investigators as pathway authorities based on their expertise in individual signaling pathways. The review by pathway authorities occasionally leads to correction of errors or, more commonly, to inclusion of additional information. Finally, the pathway authorities help in assessing whether the work of all major laboratories has been incorporated for the given signaling pathway.

            References are captured at three levels. First, each pathway as a whole requires a reference. For signaling pathways, at least three references, usually review papers, are required in order to provide a more objective view of the scope of the pathway. For metabolic pathways, a textbook reference is usually sufficient. Second, references are often associated to each molecule class in the pathway. Most of these references are OMIM records or review papers. Third, references are provided to support association of specific protein sequences with a particular molecule class, e.g., the SWISS-PROT sequence P53_HUMAN annotated as an instance of the molecule class ‘‘P53’’ appearing in the pathway class ‘‘P53 pathway’’. These are usually research papers that report the experimental evidence that a particular protein or gene participates in the reactions represented in the pathway diagram.
            There are three major properties that make this infrastructure differ from other pathway curation systems, such as from Reactome and EcoCyc. First, the pathway diagrams are drawn with CellDesigner software. There are two advantages to using CellDesigner. First, controlled graphical notations are used to draw the pathway diagram, and the software automatically creates a computational representation that is compatible with the SBML standard. Second, a pathway diagram can be viewed with an exact, one-to-one correspondence with the ontological representation of the pathways stored in the back-end. The second property is that the scope of the pathway is defined first based on literature, and pathway components (proteins, genes, RNAs) are treated as ontology terms, or molecule classes, rather than specific instances. This means that multiple proteins from the same organism or different organisms can potentially play the same given role in a pathway. The advantage is that the work flow is more similar to the thinking process of the biologists who are the users of our curation software module. The third major property is that the curation software is designed to be simple enough to be used directly by bench biologists after a brief training course. All other pathway databases we are aware of employ highly trained curators, who of course cannot be experts in all areas of biology. The current set of PANTHER pathways has been curated by more than 40 different external experts from the scientific community; they must only have demonstrated their expertise with publications in the relevant field.

At present, SPIKE database imports such data from Reactome, KEGG, NetPath and The Transcription Factor Encyclopedia (http://www.cisreg.ca/cgi-bin/tfe/home.pl). (iii) Data on protein–protein interactions (PPIs) imported either directly from wide-scale studies that recorded such interactions [to date,PPI data were imported from Stelzl et al., Rual et al. and Lim et al.] or from external PPI databases [IntAct and MINT (19)]. Relationship data coming from these different sources vary greatly in their quality and this is reflected by a quality level attribute, which is attached to each relationship in SPIKE database (Supplementary Data). Each relationship in SPIKE is linked to at least one PubMed reference that supports it.
            As of August 2010, the SPIKE database contains 20 412 genes/proteins, 542 complexes (327 of high quality), 320 protein families (167 of high quality) and 39 small molecules. These entities are linked by 34 338 interactions (of which 2400 are of high quality) and 6074 regulations (4420 of high quality). These are associated with 5873 journal references in total.
            Each of the maps is constructed by a domain expert; typically the same expert will also be responsible later for keeping it up-to-date. The expert reads the relevant literature and identifies those interactions and regulations that are pertinent to the pathway.
            The regulations and interactions in the database are assigned quality values ranging from 1 to 4. In general, relationships (regulations and interactions) derived from highly focused biochemical studies are assigned high quality (2 or 1) while those derived from high-throughput experiments are assigned lower quality (4 or 3). The curator uses best judgment to assign a quality level. For example, relationships mentioned in two independent research reports, or cited repeatedly in reviews written by leading authorities will get quality 1. Relationships with cited concrete references and those imported en masse from external curated signaling DBs are initially assigned quality 2 but later can be changed to the highest quality after the curator has read and was convinced by the cited papers. Data imported from protein-protein interaction DBs and datasets are assigned quality 3 or 4, depending on the experimental technique.

            The information within the IntAct database primarily consists of protein–protein interaction (PPI) data. The majority of the PPI data within the database is annotated to IMEx standards, as agreed by the IMEx consortium. All such records contain a full description of the experimental conditions in which the interaction was observed. This includes full details of the constructs used in each experiment, such as the presence and position of tags, the minimal binding region defined by deletion mutants and the effect of any point mutations, referenced to UniProtKB (2), the underlying protein sequence database. Protein interactions can be described down to the isoform level, or indeed to the post-translationally cleaved mature peptide level if such information is available in the publication, using the appropriate UniProtKB identifiers.
            Each entry in IntAct is peer reviewed by a senior curator, and not released until accepted by that curator. Additional rule-based checks are run at the database level, and manually fixed when necessary. Finally, on release of the data, the original author of each publication is contacted and asked to comment on the representation of their data; again manual updates are made to the entry should the author highlight any errors.
            All binary interactions evidences in the IntAct database, including those generated by Spoke expansion of co-complex data, are clustered to produce a non-redundant set of protein pairs (R. C. Jimenez et al., manuscript in preparation). Each binary pair is then scored, using a simple addition of the cumulated value of a weighted score for the interaction detection method and the interaction type for each interaction evidence associated with that binary pair, as described using the PSI-MI CV terms. The scores are given in Table 1, all children of each given parent receives that score. Only experimental data is scored, inferred interactions, for example, would be excluded. Any low confidence data or data manually tagged by a curator for exclusion from the process, would not be scored. Isoforms and post-processed protein chains are regarded as distinct proteins for scoring purposes.

            We can not draw a sharp distinction between low and high throughput methods, and I can agree, that this is not the only and best measure of quality considering experimental data. I see that IntAct came up with a good solution to estimate the confidence of interactions. The mi-score system gives a comprehensive way to synthetize information from multiple experiments, and weight interactions according to experimental methods, interaction type, and number of evidences.

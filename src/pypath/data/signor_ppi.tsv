Exposure of c2c12 cells to jagged2 led to increased amounts of notch mrna as well as mrnas for a second notch receptor, notch3, and a second notch ligand, jagged1. Constitutively active forms of notchl in c2c12 cells also induced increased levels of the same set of mrnas, suggesting positive feedback control of these genes initiated by binding of jagged2 to notch1.

These results define tab2 as an adaptor linking tak1 and traf6 and as a mediator of tak1 activation in the il-1 signaling pathway . taken together, these results indicate that polyubiquitination of rip1 mediates the independent recruitment of tab2 and nemo, which in turn recruits tak1 and ikk, respectively, to tnf-r1.

ERBB2	PROTEIN	P04626	UNIPROT	ERBB3	PROTEIN	P21860	UNIPROT	Activates	Binding			9606;9606							12648465	YES	Most breast, skin, lung, ovary, and gastrointestinal tract tumors express ErbB-3, and heterodimerization of this receptor with ErbB-2, may be involved in some cancers.	Although erbb-2 binds neither ligand, even in a heterodimeric receptor complex, it is the preferred heterodimer partner of the three other members, and it favors interaction with erbb-3.
